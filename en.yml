    indexkey: 'At Beary Best! we seek to retain the carefree charms and ways of a
                    backpacker hostel and simply to provide the true essentials: comfortable
                    and good value accommodation.

                    Carefully restored from an art deco heritage building, we offer a calm,
                    laid back and friendly environment with all the facilities.
                    we believe truly matters for travelers... a dedicated lounge/dining area.
                    Multiple female & unisex bathrooms, dorms of various sizes, 
                    bike storage'
